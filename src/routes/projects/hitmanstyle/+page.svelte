		This was an untitled project that I worked on for a game modification
		class while at DePaul. The idea was to create a stealth based game from
		the Lyra game pack created by Epic. I worked within the level design
		team and designed the concept of the three lane approach to create an
		easy, medium, hard path for the player to choose how they would like to
		complete the level.

		Each path offered the player a different option on how to play. The left
		lane was a high visibility lane that offered more rewards and ammunition
		if the player chose to explore that path, while the middle lane was
		easier but offered less rewards and opportunities to find items.

	The team also decided to make the level multi-layered so that the player had
	different options for each lane as well. With different difficulties for
	each of the lanes they branched off of. If the player felt they got in too
	deep on one lane they could switch to a different lane, or if they didnâ€™t
	feel challenged enough they could take an alley and spike up the difficulty
	for themself.

	Below are the various phases that the level went through during the level
	design process. The level was blocked out in Lyra so that the development
	team could jump in quickly and give feedback for the next iteration of the
	level. This allowed the playtesters to give valueable feedback and the level
	was changed and shrunk through this interactive process.
