		This is a level design project that I completed to conceptualize using
		in game cinematics and atmosphere to tell a story instead of using
		dialogue. The concept for this project was to use level design to tell
		the narrative through player interactions and real time events that
		happen as the player explores the level.

	The concept for this level was an abandoned space station that the player
	wakes up on and as they explore they realize that thereâ€™s something
	happening on the station with them. The player would explore through the
	space station and through the use of triggers the level would play out in
	front of the player.

		The video below is a quick setup of some simple door mechanics to set up
		the correct speed and animation of doors to give the player a proper
		reveal of the space station.
