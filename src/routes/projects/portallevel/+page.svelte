			This is a level design project that I completed to conceptualize
			using in game cinematics and atmosphere to tell a story instead of
			using dialogue. The concept for this project was to use level design
			to tell the narrative through player interactions and real time
			events that happen as the player explores the level.

		<Card>
			The concept for this level was an abandoned space station that the
			player wakes up on and as they explore they realize that thereâ€™s
			something happening on the station with them. The player would
			explore through the space station and through the use of triggers
			the level would play out in front of the player.
