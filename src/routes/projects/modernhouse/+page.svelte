	<p>
		The concept for this project was to create a modern house using only a
		limited amount of materials. The main two being Concrete and Glass. From
		there I wanted to have a simplistic design that was modern but still
		felt lived in.
	</p>
	<p>
		The design of the house was modeled so that the house would sit in the
		sun line. Using this I strategically placed the bedroom and the kitchen
		in the east facing side of the structure to allow for the morning to
		light those rooms as you would naturally occupy them. I placed the
		office in the west side of the home for the same reason, giving the
		office the mid-day light and into the evening. The project was an
		exercise in modern design, feng shui, as well as real world
		implementations to try to build a house that would be interesting to
		conceptualize
